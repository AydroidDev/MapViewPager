# MapViewPager

Android library that connects ViewPager fragments with Google Maps markers and makes them work together.


## Features

- [x] Support for more than 1 marker per fragment
- [x] Default position for fragments with more than one marker automatically calculated


## Download

#### Gradle

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "http://dl.bintray.com/moreno/maven" 
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.nitrico.mapviewpager:mapviewpager:0.0.1'
}
```



## Usage

##### For 1 (or 0) markers per fragment:

Create a ViewPager adapter extending from `MapViewPager.Adapter` and override method
```java
public CameraPosition getCameraPosition(int position)
``` 
returning the marker camera position for fragment each fragment.

You can create it like that 
```
CameraPosition.builder().target(new LatLng(latitude, longitud)).zoom(zoom).build()
```

*MapViewPager.Adapter extends from FragmentStatePagerAdapter so, like in any other ViewPager, you also need to override methods*
```java
public int getCount()
public Fragment getItem(int position)
```
and probably want to override
```java
public CharSequence getPageTitle(int position)
```

Include it in your xml layout

```xml
<com.github.nitrico.mapviewpager.MapViewPager
        android:id="@+id/mapViewPager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:viewPagerWeight="1"
        app:mapWeight="1"
        app:mapGravity="1"
        app:mapOffset="56dp" />
```
